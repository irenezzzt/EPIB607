## Course Overview  {-}


Introduction to the basic principles of statistical inference used in
clinical and epidemiologic research. Topics include variability; methods
of processing and describing data; sampling and sampling distributions;
inferences regarding means and proportions, non-parametric methods,
regression and correlation.


The principal audience is researchers in the natural and social sciences
who haven't had an introductory course in statistics (or did have one a
long time ago). This audience accepts that statistics has penetrated the
life sciences pervasively and is required knowledge for both doing
research and understanding scientific papers.

## Instructor Message Regarding Course Delivery {-}

Life absolutely sucks right now. None of us is really okay. **We're all just pretending.**

You most likely know people who have lost their jobs, have tested positive for COVID-19, have been hospitalized, or have even died (I myself know people in all those categories). You all have increased (or possibly decreased) work responsibilities and increased family care responsibilitiesâ€”you might be caring for extra people (young and/or old!) right now, and you are likely facing uncertain job prospects (or have been laid off!).

**I'm fully committed to making sure that you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class!** I will make whatever accommodations I can to help you finish your problem sets, do well on your projects, and learn and understand the class material. Under ordinary conditions, I am flexible and lenient with grading and course expectations when students face difficult challenges. Under pandemic conditions, that flexibility and leniency is intensified.

If you tell me you're having trouble, I will not judge you or think less of you. I hope you'll extend me the same grace.

You *never* owe me personal information about your health (mental or physical). You are *always* welcome to talk to me about things that you're going through, though. If I can't help you, I usually know somebody who can.

If you need extra help, or if you need more time with something, or if you feel like you're behind or not understanding everything, **do not suffer in silence!** Talk to me! I will work with you. **I promise.**

I want you to learn lots of things from this class, but I primarily want you to stay healthy, balanced, and grounded during this crisis.

## Learning Outcomes {-}


The aim of this course is to provide students with basic principles of
statistical inference so that they can:

-   Visualize/Analyze/Interpret data using statistical methods with the
    `R` statistical software program.

-   Understand the statistical results in a scientific paper.

-   Apply statistical methods in their own research.

-   Use the methods learned in this course as a foundation for more
    advanced biostatistics courses.

## Instructional Method {-}


**This course will follow the Flipped Classroom model**: Here, students
are expected to have engaged with the material before coming to class. 
This allows the instructor to delegate the delivery of basic content and definitions to
textbooks and videos, and enforces the idea that students cannot be
simply passive recipients of information. This approach then allows the
professor to focus valuable class time on nurturing efficient
discussions surrounding the ideas within the content, guiding
interactive exploration of typical misconceptions, and promoting
collaborative problem solving with peers.

**A focus on computation**: Classic introductory statistics textbooks
were written during a time when computers were still in their infancy.
As such, even the newer editions heavily rely on by-hand computations
such as looking up tables for tail probabilities. We take a modern
approach and introduce computational methods in statistics with the
statistical software program `R`. Assignments must be submitted in
`R Markdown` format to ensure reproducible results.


## Required Course Materials {-}


Course notes
------------

These are available as a PDF document on myCourses to download. Extra
material such as `R` code and class schedule will be made available on
myCourses. You will also be asked to watched the accompanying [Against
all odds video
series](https://www.learner.org/courses/againstallodds/unitpages/index.html)
by Annenberg Learner.

Equipment
---------

Hand calculators (with square root, log, and exponential function) are
required. Laptops for in-class exercises can be useful but is not
required.

Software
--------

The `R` software package will be introduced and used for in-class
illustrations. `R` is available under GPL (free) at
[](http://cran.r-project.org/).\
It is recommended to use the RStudio interactive development environment
(IDE) which can be downloaded for free at [](http://www.rstudio.com/).\
**Note:** to use RStudio, you must first download the `R` software
package at the link provided above.

Tutorials from DataCamp
-----------------------

This class is supported by DataCamp, which will allow you to learn `R`
through a combination of short expert videos and hands-on-the-keyboard
exercises. You will be asked to complete some of the courses in DataCamp
for background reading or for assignments. You can sign up for a free
account at this
[link](https://www.datacamp.com/groups/shared_links/a10245cf1485dc55a1ee21a23d6dfe6ae703fd60).
