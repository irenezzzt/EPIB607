## Notation 

* **Variables and Subscripts**  
Variable $Y$ with $n$ sample values denoted $y_1, y_2, ..., y_n$ in order of entry; The "1", "2", ... are called subscripts or indices. We use the letter i (or j) and the range "1 to n" to denote the n different $y$ values and refer to the value of the ith $y$ as "$y_i$".

* **Summation**  
The term $\Sigma y$ (spoken: "sigma y" or "sum of y's") is used as a shorthand for the sum $y_1 + y_2 + \dots  + y_n$.


## Powers, Logarithms and Antiâ€“logarithms 

* The term $y^{1/2}$ is shorthand for the square root of $y$ or $\sqrt{y}$. Likewise, $y^{1/n}$ denotes the n-th root of $y$.    

* $\ln (y)$ denotes the "natural log of $y$" or "log of $y$ to
the base e" i.e. log$_e(x)$, where e is 2.718.  
Note: y must be positive; ln ($y$) ranges from -$\inf$ to +$\inf$.  
&nbsp;  
ln (0.1) = -2.30; ln (1) = 0; ln (2) = 0.69; ln (10) =2.30

* $\ln(A \times B) =  \ln(A) + \ln(B); \ \ \ \ln(\frac{A}{B}) =  \ln(A) - \ln(B)$

* exp($y$) is shorthand for $e^y$ or "exponential of $y$" or the natural anti-log of $y$. $y$ ranges from -$\infty$ to +$\infty$. and exp($y$) yields a positive value. eg. exp(-1) = 0.36; exp(0) =1; exp(.5) =1.64; exp(1) = 2.71...
